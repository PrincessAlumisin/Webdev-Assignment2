        <h1 class="title">Display Property</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Inline</h2>
            <p>When an element's display property is set to inline, the element will not begin on a new line and will occupy the entire amount of available screen space. 
                It just occupies the space that such an element would typically occupy. <span class="a">This is an example of inline element.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Block</h2>
            <p>When the display property is set to block, an element begins on a new line and takes up the entire 
                available screen width.<span class="b">This is an example of a block element.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Inline-Block</h2>
            <p>An element that you give an inline-block display to is inline by presentation. 
                However, it has the added benefit of allowing you to apply width and height, which you are unable to do when the 
                element has an inline display given to it. <span class="c">This is an example of inline-block element.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: None</h2>
            <p>When you set an element's display property to none, the element completely disappears from 
                the page and has no bearing on the layout. <span class="d">This is an example of none element.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Flex</h2>
            <p>A display of flex gives you access to the Flex layout system, 
                which simplifies how we design and layout our web pages.<span class="e">This is an example flex display property</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Inherit</h2>
            <p>This makes the element inherit the display property of its parent. So, if you have a span tag inside a div and you give the span tag a display of inherit, 
                it turns it from inline to block element.<span class="f">This is an example of inherit display property.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Initial</h2>
            <p>This sets the display property of an element to its default value. So, if you set the display property of a span to initial, 
                it remains inline, and if you set the same value for a div, it remains block.<span class="g">This is an example of initial display property</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Display: Flex</h2>
            <p>A display of flex gives you access to the Flex layout system, which simplifies how we design and layout our web pages.
                <span class="h">This is an example of flex display property.</span>
            </p>
